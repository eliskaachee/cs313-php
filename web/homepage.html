					<p>I am a Senior Computer Science student. I currently work for FamilySearch as a Web Developer, and I love it, and it has helped me appreciate my Family History more.</p>
					<p>I am from Folsom, California, and I served a mission in the "Great Kentucky Louisville Mission" -- God Bless It!</p>
					<p>Some of my hobbies include calligraphy, painting, and crocheting. Of all of the topics I've studied at school, web development has been my favorite.</p>
